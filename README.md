# OpenCore Hackintosh on HP EliteDesk 800 G3 
<img align="right" height="200" width="280"  src="Assets/neofetch.png">

This is a repository where I store files that were configured to run macOS properly on HP EliteDesk 800 G3.

You can use the EFI folder or refer to the configurations here to make your own bootable macOS installation USB. More information on creating bootable macOS installation USB please checkout the [official guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/) from OpenCore. If you are on the same HP model or system, you can copy or modify my EFI folder and place it into EFI partition of your USB.

Explainations for files and configurations are presented in way that user can understand and apply for his/her own PC with the same system or model.

>**Disclaimer**: I do not own any responsibilities if your PC running into problems by patching the files or applying the guide here. Please do your own research.

## SSDTs üóÇ

Below are three SSDTs required for my system.
To find SSDTs for your system, please refer to [this document](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/ssdt-methods/ssdt-prebuilt.html).

- SSDT-EC-USBX-DESKTOP.aml

**Required**

- HfsPlus.efi
- OpenRuntime.efi

**Optional**

- OpenCanopy.efi (for enabling OpenCore GUI bootloader)
- AudioDxe.efi (for enabling boot chime)

>Location: `EFI/OC/Drivers/`            

## KEXTS üíâ

**Required**

- [Lilu.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/Lilu)
- [WhateverGreen.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen)
- [VirtualSMC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC)
- [AppleALC.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC)
- [IntelMausi.kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/IntelMausi)
- [USBPorts.kext](Created using Hackintool)

**Optional**

- SMCProcessor.kext (for monitoring CPU temperature, included in `VirtualSMC` package)
- SMCSuperIO.kext (for monitoring fan speed, included in `VirtualSMC` package)
- [CPUFriend.kext](https://github.com/stevezhengshiqi/one-key-cpufriend) (CPU power management, please ignore if you are not certain about this one) 
- CPUFriendDataProvider.kext (same as `CPUFriend.kext`)

## USB PORTS MAPPING ‚åó (deprecated &rarr; switched to Hackintool mapping method)
The USBPorts.kext file in the EFI folder was created using [Hackintool](https://github.com/headkaze/Hackintool). The kext file is used to recognize all the ports of my machine.
If you are having a different model, you can refer to the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBbD4pGFhIU&ab_channel=TechLabs) for making one. Thanks to Tech Labs.


## SPECIFIC CONFIGURATIONS

### Boot arguments

**Required (only remove when you are good with your set up)**

- `-v`: boot macOS in verbose mode
- `debug=0x100`: prevents macOS not to reboot when facing a kernel panic, this will help giving you some insights why the system is not booting.
- `keepsyms=1`: prints the symbols during a kernel panic.

**Extras**  

You will notice that the `boot-args` from my `config.plist` file has the argument `alcid=20`. It will be needed for playing boot chime with internal audio. The number `20` is layout ID for my Conexant audio device, which you can find all the supported coded in this [page](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleALC/wiki/Supported-codecs).

Also, there is an extra argument `igfxonln=1` that I aimed to force all displays online for fixing wake issue (but not helped at all). You may want to delete this argument.

>So literally you will need this in your `boot-args`: `-v debug=0x100 keepsyms=1 alcid=xx`, with `xx` is your audio layout ID.


### Graphics acceleration

Follow the guide over [here](https://github.com/dortania/vanilla-laptop-guide-legacy/tree/master/OpenCore/config-laptop.plist) by choosing your correct CPU model name.     
From my system on Kaby Lake and Intel Graphics HD 630, I will need to set
- AAPL,ig-platform-id   |   DATA    |   <00001659>      

under `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x2,0x0)` from `DeviceProperties` section of `config.plist` file.

>Notice: If you are on HD 630, it's safe to choose <00001659> as <00001B59> caused an issue for one of my DisplayPorts (not receive signal after booting).

### GUI bootloader and Boot chime
Follow the guide from OpenCore [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/cosmetic/gui.html#setting-up-boot-chime-with-audiodxe)

**GUI bootloader**  
I already included the EFI folder that contains Resources for a GUI bootloader, and also configured the `config.plist`.     
If you want to modify the theme, feel free to change it from the property `Misc -> Boot -> PickerVariant` of `config.plist` file. Options can be found [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/cosmetic/gui.html#setting-up-opencore-s-gui).

**Boot chime**
>Important: if you are not using my EFI folder, make sure you have `AudioDxe.efi` in your `EFI/OC/Drivers/` and it must be on the same OpenCore version with `HfsPlus.efi` and `OpenRuntime.efi`.

You need to define two things below in order to get boot chime:
- `AudioCodec`: go to Terminal and run:
```
ioreg -rxn IOHDACodecDevice | grep IOHDACodecAddress
```
Then you will probably see this:
```
  |   "IOHDACodecAddress" = 0x0
  |   "IOHDACodecAddress" = 0x2
```
There will be few lines appear on Terminal, mostly will be two. First is the internal audio (in my case that is the Conexant one), and the second one will be HDMI/DVI sound. In this case I will pick `0x0` for the `AudioCodec` as I want to play boot chime from the internal audio.     
You can change it to another value appears, if it won't work, just switch to another one.

- `AudioDevice`: run [gfxutil](https://github.com/acidanthera/gfxutil/releases) to find the path
```
/path/to/gfxutil -f HDEF
```
You will receive something like this:
```
00:1f.3 8086:a2f0 /PCI0@0/HDEF@1F,3 = PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)
```
Grab the right part after the `=`, in my case it would be `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1F,0x3)`.

>After get the `AudioCodec` and `AudioDevice`, put them under `UEFI -> Audio`. Other configurations I have already made, you can change the others if you know.
